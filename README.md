The "Kabouterboom" is a [450-year old tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Zicht_op_de_Kabouterboom%2C_een_tamme_kastanje_en_de_dikste_boom_van_Nederland_-_Beek_-_20537000_-_RCE.jpg) in the Netherlands.  With its almost nine meter circumference it's the thickest tree in the Netherlands, and it's also the fifth-oldest tree in the Netherlands.  Its name translates into English as "Gnome tree", because surely it houses lots of gnomes.
